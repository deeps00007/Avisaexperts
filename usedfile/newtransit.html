      <h1>What is a Transit Visa?</h1>
      <p>
        A transit visa allows travelers to pass through a country on their way to another destination. It is usually needed if you are staying in the country for a short duration before continuing your journey to a third country. Many countries require a transit visa even if you are staying in the airport for a few hours, so it’s essential to check the visa requirements for the country you are transiting through.

    <div class="features">
      <h2>Key Feature</h2>
      <p><strong>Short Duration:</strong> Transit visas are usually valid for a very limited period, often 24 to 72 hours, depending on the country’s regulations.</p>
      <p><strong>Limited Access:</strong> The visa usually allows travelers to stay in the airport’s international transit area, and in some cases, it may permit them to leave the airport for a brief time to explore the city or rest before their next flight.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of a transit visa is to facilitate onward travel. It is not meant for extended stays, tourism, or business activities in the transit country.</p>
      <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Applicants typically need to provide proof of onward travel, such as a confirmed flight ticket, a valid visa (if required) for the final destination, and sufficient funds for the short stay.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h2>When Is It Needed?</h2>
      <p><strong>Airport Layovers:</strong> When a layover in a country requires leaving the international transit zone.</p>
      <p><strong>Connecting Flights:</strong> When switching airports within the same country during a layover.</p>
      <p><strong>Land Travel:</strong> When traveling through one country to reach another by land, such as driving through a country to reach the final destination.</p>
